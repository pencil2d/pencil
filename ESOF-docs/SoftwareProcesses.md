# Software Processes in Pencil2D

## Introduction

## Software Process Roles

In any software development process there are different roles performed by the people involved. If the team is not very strictly organized, these roles may be somewhat merged and performed by a same person. This seems to be the case with Pencil2D, as we discuss below, where we present the main roles that can be found in the project.

### Client

In general, the role of client is performed by a representative of the organization that requested the software. Sometimes, the person performing this role is not from the client company, but from the development company. In any case, its the job of this person to guarantee that the software requirements are met, as well as generally speak for the client company.

Pencil2D does not have a client company. Not in the strict sense at least. The software is simply being developed for anyone who might have an interest in its features. Although "random" people on the internet do make feature requests, these people do not have a representative that coordinates their efforts. Also, since they are not paying for anything, there is a clear limit to how much pressure they can place on the development team. Thus, the role of the client is somewhat performed by whomever decides to use the application and comment on it, but with many restrictions in their power to really influence the development process.

### Project Manager

The project manager is, in a sense, the leader of the development team. It is their responsibility to supervise the planning, execution and, eventually, conclusion of the project. Also, most of the decisions may fall on the project manager.

Currently, the project manager of Pencil2D seems to be the main developer: [Matt Chang](https://github.com/chchwy). This is the person in charge of driving the project forward, either by personally contributing with increments, or by coordinating the efforts of others and ensuring that their contributions are successfully merged. Matt is also the person that started Pencil2D, by forking it from the "dead" project Pencil.

### Developer

The developer(s) of a software project are responsible for both the design and the programming. In ancient software development methods, these roles where performed by different people. While some would theoretically conceive the whole application, like the architects who create the plans for a building; others would actually code these ideas, thus being the constructors of the building. This is not the case anymore, not in any current software development process. The main reason for this being the fact that, these days, software is so complex and has so many lines of code, it would be virtually impossible for any person to simply conceive the whole design, while not getting involved in the actual programming.

As stated above, Pencil2D has a main developer, who contributes most of the design and code. The other developers, making a current total of 14, vary a lot productivity. Some have only made on or two short commits, while others have contributed some thousand lines of code. In any case, they all seem to be free agents, instead of belonging to a cohesive team. 

## Software Process Activities

All software processes are characterized by similar activities, although the way they are organized depends on each specific process. In this section we describe the four main activities and the way they are addressed in Pencil2D. 

### Specification

The objective of software specification is to determine the requirements of the software. The client should let the development team know how the software will be used, by whom, to which effect and under what circumstances. It is very important to decide what the software is supposed to do with precision, because everything else will follow from this stage. 

A part from the user requirements, system requirements, which are more detailed and oriented for the software developers, also should be determined in the phase. This whole part of the process can be split in four activities:

1. Feasibility Study - A quick analysis to decide whether the project is possible and cost-effective, whose result should inform if further analysis should be mande;  
2. Requirement Elicitation - The system requirements are obtained from the discussion with potential users and the observation of other systems;
3. Requirements Specification - The information from the previous stage is written in a document;
4. Requirements Validation - The requirements are checked for consistency, realism and completeness.

These activities may not be performed strictly in this order. Also, the software requirements may be updated throughout the development, depending on the software process used.

It is not completely clear how the software specification was initially performed in Pencil2D. The idea was to develop "a tool for creating traditional animation, using both bitmap and vector graphics; which was intuitive, cool, light, open source, cross-platform...". However, we could not find a detailed list of early system requirements, from the time of Pencil. 

In any case, there is a task list, dating from the time when Pencil was forked into Pencil2D, whose contents are features to be added to the software. Since there is no proper client for the application, that part of their role was performed by the Project Manager.

### Design and Implementation

This is the stage where the software is actually built in order to match the system requirements. In order to accomplish that, there are processes of design and programming.

The design is a description of the structure of the software, its interfaces and sometimes the algorithms that will be used. The different components of the software should be identified and described, as well as their organization as a whole. The interfaces between different components and between the software and the user also need to be detailed.

The following image from the development of Pencil2D gives some indication of this design process.
