To compile Pencil for OS X Power PC "out of the box"
0) Install XCode and Apple Developer Kit if you haven't done it
1) Install Qt from TrollTech if you haven't done it
2) Open pencil.pro with Qt Creator
3) Go to Qt Creator->Preferences->Build & Run
4) Under "Qt Versions" make sure qmake is located
5) Under "Compilers" make sure Clang x64 is present
6) Under "Kits" select default and chose your Compiler and QT Version
7) Now everything is ready, Just click the Run button to build and run Pencil

====================================================================
Qt on Mac

-> The Qt framework is needed to create the graphical interface of Pencil
Use the installer from http://qt-project.org/downloads

I've used Qt 4.7.4 on the current version

You could also install Qt through a package manager such as Homebrew


====================================================================
Ming (Flash/SWF library) on Mac (This feature is not implemented in v0.5)
-> The Ming library enables Pencil to export animation to the Flash/SWF format
www.libming.org
I've used Ming 0.3
Because of some obscure library name conflict on the Mac, I couldn't use Ming as a dynamic library.
(I think this is because Ming links against libpng which is also present in the System/Library/ApplicationServices as libPng.
If anyone manages to use Ming (with PNG support) a dynamic library, please let me know.)

Instead I had to use it a static library
I put the compiled library (libming.a) and the header files (*.h) in
the "libmacosx" directory, as a convenience, so that you don't need to compile it yourself
(maybe you need on an Intel Mac, though).
If needed, you can get the latest files from www.libming.org and compile them yourself.


====================================================================
Deploying Pencil/Mac OS X
I chose to ship the Qt libraries within the app.
In order to link the pencil.app against these local Qt libraries, I made the script "macdeploy.sh"

Make sure your Pencil application is built and follow these steps :

0) Open macdeploy.sh in a text editor
1) Set the app path and QT lib path based on your environment.
2) Open a terminal, and go to the folder where macdeploy.sh is located
3) type "sudo sh ./macdeploy.sh"
4) You should have a stand alone version of your application and a ready to share .dmg file in your build folder
