## Using Pencil2D

Note that the following guides and documentation are outdated.

Pencil2D comes with a Quick Reference that you can use to familiarize yourself with the tools and functions at your disposal. After opening Pencil2D, you can access it through the main menu: Help > Quick Reference Guide.

We encourage you to visit our [User Manual][user-man] for a quick guide for novice users, then play around with the program – it's fun!
